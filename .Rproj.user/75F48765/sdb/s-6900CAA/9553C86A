This chapter describes the recommended way to install R and R packages across different platform.\n\n## R Installation\n### Windows\nThe best way to install R on a Windows PC is to download the binary executable from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). Click through \"Download R for Windows\" and \"install R for the first time\" to get the file. For example, the latest stable version is [R-3.2.4revised-win.exe](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.2.4revised-win.exe) when this chapter was written.\n\nOne can also find older versions of R under the CRAN's [/bin/windows/base/old](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/) folder.\n\nThe installation of R for Windows from the above executable file will also include a GUI tool called `RGui.exe` for interactive development purpose.\n\n### OS X (Mac)\nThe best way to install R on a Mac is to download the binary package file from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). Click through \"Download R for (Mac) OS X\" and download the latest stable version. For example, the latest stable version is [R-3.2.4.pkg](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.2.4.pkg) when this chapter was written.\n\nOne can also find older versions of R under the CRAN's [/bin/macosx/base/old](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/old/) folder.\n\nThe installation of R for Mac from the above pacakge file will also include a GUI tool called `R.app` for interactive development purpose. \n\n### Ubuntu\nThere are many ways to get R installed on a Linux box. Here we use Ubuntu as an example. \n\nNaturally one would probably like to check if there is already available compiled package from any repository of your distribution. To do so, use `sudo apt-cache policy r-base` and something like the following may return:\n\n```sh\nr-base:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 3.0.2-1ubuntu1\n  Version table:\n     3.0.2-1ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://mirrors.digitalocean.com/ubuntu/ trusty/universe amd64 Packages\n```\n\nBut generally the compiled version on Ubuntu default repository won't catch up with the latest one on CRAN. If it is okay to install the older version of R then all the things left to do is a simple `sudo apt-get install r-base`.\n\nHowever, if one would like to install the latest stable version of R, a mirror of CRAN must be setup. This is documented in details under CRAN's [bin/linux/ubuntu/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) folder.\n\nFor Ubuntu 14.04, add `deb https://<my.favorite.cran.mirror>/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/` to `/etc/apt/sources.list`, where `<my.favorite.cran.mirror>` should be replaced with one of the preferred mirrors from [CRAN's mirror list](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). One choice is the NTU mirror so the added line to the sources.list file will be: \n\n```\ndeb https://http://cran.csie.ntu.edu.tw//bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/\n```\n\nAfter this is done, use `sudo apt-get update` to update the package manager and use `sudo apt-get install r-base` to install the latest version of R. You may also like to do `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev` to further install developer's tools.\n\nIf there is any error concerning the secure key issue, consult the \"Secure APT\" section for solution.\n\n### Update the R Installation\n\n## R Package Installation\n\n### Use `install.packages`\n\n#### From CRAN\n\n#### From Source\n\n### Use `devtools::install_github`\n\n\n",
