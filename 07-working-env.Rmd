# Working Directory {#work-env}

Use `getwd` to query the current working directory. To change working directory, use `setwd`. For Windows user, the path separator is typically the back-slash `\`. But it is the escape character in R so if one would like to use back-slash it must be escaped, for example, like this:

```r
setwd("C:\\Users\\kylechung")
```

or equivalently one could still follow *nix convention:

```r
setwd("C:/Users/kylechung")
```

## Library Search Path

Use `.libPaths` to show the path(es) that will be searched by R.

## Save / Load

`save` and `save.image`
